# Todo React TS

<!-- use some gif demo -->

## Description

This app is a simple todo list app where we can add to dos to a list. I've used TypeScript and the Framer-Motion package (for CSS animations) for this app. I also implemented some basic unit-tests for testing the "Add Todo" button disable/enabled state.

### Goal

I made this app in order to practice what I've learned about the technologies I've mentiones.
