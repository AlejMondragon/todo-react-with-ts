# Todo React TS

## Description

This app is a simple todo list app where we can add to dos to a list. I've used TypeScript and the Framer-Motion package (for CSS animations) for this app. I also implemented some basic unit-tests for testing the "Add Todo" button disable/enabled state and used the context API to manage my state globally.

### Goal

I made this app mostly in order to practice what I've learned about TypeScript and Framer-Motion, two technologies I really enjoyed. I also took the opportunity to once again practice using unit-testing and the context API.
